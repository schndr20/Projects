The wines normally are packed with plum and cherry flavors which are supported by firm tannins. They pair well with a wide range of food making them an easy choice for a dinner.

Being surrounded by mountains on all sides has its advantages. The Dão region is protected from the climate of the continent and from the ocean. The elevation also gives the wine much of its character. Elevation ranges between 600 feet to 3,000 feet at some points.

Vinho Verde is a light, refreshing wine with lots of floral and green fruit notes. The wine often has a slight carbonation to it, though not enough that it could be referred to as a sparkling wine.

A Vinho Verde region was established in 1908, though the area didn't receive its Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) until 1984. The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.

The carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.

Because of the wine's bracing acidity and oceanic minerality it should be considered to be the ultimate partner to raw shellfish.",4.1,102,4.0,405,10.95,vc,"Arinto de Bucelas, Loureiro, Alvarinho, Azal, Avesso, Batoca","['Growers quite often plant their vines of telephone poles of large walls in order to grow fruit and vegetables beneath the vines.', 'Vinho Verde is a wine intended to be consumed young.', ""15% of Portugal's natural viticultural area is dedicated to the production of Vinho Verde.""]",Very light-bodied,Bottle (0.75l),4.0985675,1.5107994,1.9963006,0.0,0.0,8030611-2019,13.0,Yes,Yes,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,3,True,False,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,8,6,white

The wines normally are packed with plum and cherry flavors which are supported by firm tannins. They pair well with a wide range of food making them an easy choice for a dinner.

Being surrounded by mountains on all sides has its advantages. The Dão region is protected from the climate of the continent and from the ocean. The elevation also gives the wine much of its character. Elevation ranges between 600 feet to 3,000 feet at some points.

Most vineyards have small plots dotted through various hillsides and elevations. The soil is very poor making for stronger vines that can survive the shifts from cool nights to hot days.

Port is fortified. This means that there is an introduction of some type of distilled spirit to the wine during production. These wines can achieve an ABV of 20% or more.

This wine is commonly used for desserts or a night-cap. Vintage ports, with an actual year of production i.e 1985, are far less common and usually quite spendy.

Port is fortified. This means that there is an introduction of some type of distilled spirit to the wine during production. These wines can achieve an ABV of 20% or more.

You will encounter one of two main types of port. The first, Ruby Port, is the most common. It has a deep ruby color, is sweet, and has relatively little exposure to oak. Tawny Port is brown in color, is aged longer, and draws its color and character from longer exposure to oak.

Vinho Verde is a light, refreshing wine with lots of floral and green fruit notes. The wine often has a slight carbonation to it, though not enough that it could be referred to as a sparkling wine.

A Vinho Verde region was established in 1908, though the area didn't receive its Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) until 1984. The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.

The carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.

Because of the wine's bracing acidity and oceanic minerality it should be considered to be the ultimate partner to raw shellfish.",3.9,76,3.8,940,15.68,vc,"Arinto de Bucelas, Loureiro, Alvarinho, Azal, Avesso, Batoca","['Growers quite often plant their vines of telephone poles of large walls in order to grow fruit and vegetables beneath the vines.', 'Vinho Verde is a wine intended to be consumed young.', ""15% of Portugal's natural viticultural area is dedicated to the production of Vinho Verde.""]",Very light-bodied,Bottle (0.75l),4.3085337,1.5143995,1.9392036,0.0,0.0,6390031-2021,12.0,Yes,Yes,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,3,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,10,6,white

Vinho Verde is a light, refreshing wine with lots of floral and green fruit notes. The wine often has a slight carbonation to it, though not enough that it could be referred to as a sparkling wine.

A Vinho Verde region was established in 1908, though the area didn't receive its Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) until 1984. The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.

The carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.

76381,Burmester Jockey Club Reserva Port,Burmester,N.V.,Porto,Portuguese Port,"Produced exclusively in the Douro Valley of Northern Portugal, Port wine with its unique characteristics has become a favorite the world over.

There are scores of  different grape varieties used in the production of port. This wine is more about the production methods used and the fortification with spirit than the nuances that the fruit has to offer.

Port is fortified. This means that there is an introduction of some type of distilled spirit to the wine during production. These wines can achieve an ABV of 20% or more.

You will encounter one of two main types of port. The first, Ruby Port, is the most common. It has a deep ruby color, is sweet, and has relatively little exposure to oak. Tawny Port is brown in color, is aged longer, and draws its color and character from longer exposure to oak.

This wine is commonly used for desserts or a night-cap. Vintage ports, with an actual year of production i.e 1985, are far less common and usually quite spendy.

Port is fortified. This means that there is an introduction of some type of distilled spirit to the wine during production. These wines can achieve an ABV of 20% or more.

This wine is commonly used for desserts or a night-cap. Vintage ports, with an actual year of production i.e 1985, are far less common and usually quite spendy.

Port is fortified. This means that there is an introduction of some type of distilled spirit to the wine during production. These wines can achieve an ABV of 20% or more.

You will encounter one of two main types of port. The first, Ruby Port, is the most common. It has a deep ruby color, is sweet, and has relatively little exposure to oak. Tawny Port is brown in color, is aged longer, and draws its color and character from longer exposure to oak.

This wine is commonly used for desserts or a night-cap. Vintage ports, with an actual year of production i.e 1985, are far less common and usually quite spendy.

There are scores of  different grape varieties used in the production of port. This wine is more about the production methods used and the fortification with spirit than the nuances that the fruit has to offer.

Port is fortified. This means that there is an introduction of some type of distilled spirit to the wine during production. These wines can achieve an ABV of 20% or more.

You will encounter one of two main types of port. The first, Ruby Port, is the most common. It has a deep ruby color, is sweet, and has relatively little exposure to oak. Tawny Port is brown in color, is aged longer, and draws its color and character from longer exposure to oak.

This wine is commonly used for desserts or a night-cap. Vintage ports, with an actual year of production i.e 1985, are far less common and usually quite spendy.

Vinho Verde is a light, refreshing wine with lots of floral and green fruit notes. The wine often has a slight carbonation to it, though not enough that it could be referred to as a sparkling wine.

A Vinho Verde region was established in 1908, though the area didn't receive its Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) until 1984. The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.

The carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.

This wine is commonly used for desserts or a night-cap. Vintage ports, with an actual year of production i.e 1985, are far less common and usually quite spendy.

Vinho Verde is a light, refreshing wine with lots of floral and green fruit notes. The wine often has a slight carbonation to it, though not enough that it could be referred to as a sparkling wine.

A Vinho Verde region was established in 1908, though the area didn't receive its Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) until 1984. The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.

The carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.

A Vinho Verde region was established in 1908, though the area didn't receive its Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) until 1984. The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.

The carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.

Dry and hot are two words that commonly describe the growing regions of Southern Portugal. With as little as 23 inches of rainfall per year and summer temperatures often in excess of 100F, it's easy to see why it's considered difficult to grow great white wine.

While this area is more commonly known for reds, Antão Vaz is a white grape that has won plaudits across the wine world. Thick skinned and often similar to a lightly oaked chardonnay, it's the flagship wine of the Vidigueira region.

The wines of Southern Portugal love seafood, and work extremely well with some fresh fish, nice oily sardines or seafood paella.",4.1,86,4.1,222,32.9,vc,"Malvasia, Fernao Pires","[""The Alentejo region is far more well known for producing grain, and is unofficially called Portugal's “bread basket”."", 'Portugal is currently the 12th largest wine producing country in the world.', ""Southern Portugal is far better known for producing cork than producing wine.

Vinho Verde is a light, refreshing wine with lots of floral and green fruit notes. The wine often has a slight carbonation to it, though not enough that it could be referred to as a sparkling wine.

A Vinho Verde region was established in 1908, though the area didn't receive its Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) until 1984. The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.

There are scores of  different grape varieties used in the production of port. This wine is more about the production methods used and the fortification with spirit than the nuances that the fruit has to offer.

Port is fortified. This means that there is an introduction of some type of distilled spirit to the wine during production. These wines can achieve an ABV of 20% or more.

You will encounter one of two main types of port. The first, Ruby Port, is the most common. It has a deep ruby color, is sweet, and has relatively little exposure to oak. Tawny Port is brown in color, is aged longer, and draws its color and character from longer exposure to oak.

This wine is commonly used for desserts or a night-cap. Vintage ports, with an actual year of production i.e 1985, are far less common and usually quite spendy.

Vinho Verde is a light, refreshing wine with lots of floral and green fruit notes. The wine often has a slight carbonation to it, though not enough that it could be referred to as a sparkling wine.

A Vinho Verde region was established in 1908, though the area didn't receive its Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) until 1984. The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.

The carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.

5362570,Butler Nephew 40 Years Old Port,Butler Nephew,N.V.,Porto,Portuguese Port,"Produced exclusively in the Douro Valley of Northern Portugal, Port wine with its unique characteristics has become a favorite the world over.

There are scores of  different grape varieties used in the production of port. This wine is more about the production methods used and the fortification with spirit than the nuances that the fruit has to offer.

Port is fortified. This means that there is an introduction of some type of distilled spirit to the wine during production. These wines can achieve an ABV of 20% or more.

You will encounter one of two main types of port. The first, Ruby Port, is the most common. It has a deep ruby color, is sweet, and has relatively little exposure to oak. Tawny Port is brown in color, is aged longer, and draws its color and character from longer exposure to oak.

This wine is commonly used for desserts or a night-cap. Vintage ports, with an actual year of production i.e 1985, are far less common and usually quite spendy. Most ports are associated with a length of time of aging, like a 4-year port, or 10-year port.",4.5,42,4.5,42,145.0,vc,"Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Tinta Barroca, Souzao, Touriga Francesa","['Only wine from the Douro Valley of Portugal can legally be called Port.', 'Barrels are recycled.

Aragonez is the most widely-planted red grape in the region, which produces full-bodied, budget friendly red wines. Castelao, Trincadeira are also widely planted. Frequently, wines from this region are blends of several grapes.

Although traditional Portuguese grape varieties dominate the region, many red wines from Alentejo also incorporate international grape varieties such as Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon.

Vinho Verde is a light, refreshing wine with lots of floral and green fruit notes. The wine often has a slight carbonation to it, though not enough that it could be referred to as a sparkling wine.

Northern Portugal is big Alvarinho country, and the wonderfully crisp, almost effervescent Vinho Verde is most commonly made from this grape.

Northern Portugal is known for cheap, refreshing white wines in the coastal areas, and beautiful ports and red table wines inland in the higher ground.

The carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.

Vinho Verde is a light, refreshing wine with lots of floral and green fruit notes. The wine often has a slight carbonation to it, though not enough that it could be referred to as a sparkling wine.

A Vinho Verde region was established in 1908, though the area didn't receive its Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) until 1984. The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.

The carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.

A Vinho Verde region was established in 1908, though the area didn't receive its Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) until 1984. The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.

The carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.

Vinho Verde is a light, refreshing wine with lots of floral and green fruit notes. The wine often has a slight carbonation to it, though not enough that it could be referred to as a sparkling wine.

A Vinho Verde region was established in 1908, though the area didn't receive its Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) until 1984. The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.

The carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.
