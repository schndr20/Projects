## Curve Catch Challenge
This project focuses on classifying bra categories using various deep-learning models. The goal is to categorize bras into specific types 
such as bralettes, full cups, balconies, and plunges based on images.

### Introduction
This project leverages deep learning techniques to create a classification model for different bra categories. The dataset comprises images of bras categorized into four types: bralettes, full cups, balconies, and plunges.

### Models
Several models were implemented and evaluated for this classification task:

- FCNN
- Basic CNN
- VGG16
- VGG19
- ResNet50

### Results
The models were evaluated on a test set, and the results were recorded. The evaluation results, including accuracy and loss curves, can be found in the respective Jupyter notebooks.

### Future Improvements
To further improve this project, consider the following:

Fine-tuning the models for better performance.
Experimenting with different hyperparameters and architectures.
Incorporating data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's ability to generalize.
