## Curve Catch Challenge
CurveCatch is a company on a mission to transform the bra-wearing experience for everyone. Founded by Kimia and Nils, our platform empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their intimate clothing and revel in the comfort and confidence a well-fitting bra provides. We believe in transparency, collaboration, and the joy of finding the perfect fit.

### Introduction
This project leverages deep learning techniques to create a classification model for different bra categories. The dataset comprises images of bras categorized into four types: bralettes, full cups, balconies, and plunges.

### Models
Several models were implemented and evaluated for this classification task:

- FCNN
- Basic CNN
- VGG16
- VGG19
- ResNet50

### Results

### Future Improvements
To further improve this project, consider the following:

Fine-tuning the models for better performance.
Experimenting with different hyperparameters and architectures.
Incorporating data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's ability to generalize.
