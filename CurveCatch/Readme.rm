Introduction
This project leverages deep learning techniques to create a classification model for different bra categories. The dataset comprises images of bras categorized into four types: bralettes, full cups, balconies, and plunges.

The project involves data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation. Multiple models, including FCNN, Basic CNN, VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50, were trained and evaluated for this classification task.

Project Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset and necessary data files.
models/: Contains the trained models and saved weights.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
scripts/: Scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
predictions_final.csv: CSV file containing predictions on test images.
Usage

pip install -r requirements.txt
Follow the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

Execute the scripts in the scripts/ directory for specific tasks, such as data preprocessing and model evaluation.

Models
Several models were implemented and evaluated for this classification task:

FCNN
Basic CNN
VGG16
VGG19
ResNet50
The models are saved in the models/ directory along with their respective weights.

Results
The models were evaluated on a test set, and the results were recorded. The evaluation results, including accuracy and loss curves, can be found in the respective Jupyter notebooks.

The predictions for test images can be found in predictions_final.csv.

Future Improvements
To further improve this project, consider the following:
